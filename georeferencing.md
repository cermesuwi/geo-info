# Georeferencing

## Setting Project CRS:

* ```Project --> Properties --> CRS```. 
* Search for the CRS of interest (e.g. WGS 84) and Apply.

## Georeferencing

* Set the project CRS. 

Open the georeferencer tool:

* On menu bar, go to ```Layer --> Georeferencer```.
* In the resulting ```Georeferencer``` window, go to ```File --> Open Raster``` and browse to add the image or layer to be georeferenced.

Now set the georeferencing transformation settings in the ```Georeferencer``` window:

* Go to: ```Settings --> Transformation settings```.
* Set ```Transformation type``` = ```linear```. 
* ```Resampling method``` = ```Nearest neighbour```.
* Target SRS: click the ```Select CRS``` button and then select the CRS native to the image to be georeferenced. 
* Specify output file name and location. 
* Check ```Load in project when done```.
* In the ```Georeferencer``` window, click the ```Add Point``` tool on the toolbar and click the location for the first GCP. The ```Enter Map Coordinates``` dialog opens. 
* Enter the X and Y values for the GCP and press ```OK``` (ensuring that the CRS is the same as specified earlier). 
* Continue to place other GCPs following the same procedure.

GCP information:

**Label** | **Description** | **Lon** | **Lat** 
0 | Junction of Granby St & Bay St (Portsmouth) | -61.455949 | 15.573490 
1 | Junction of Castle Bruce Rd & East Coast Rd | -61.259719 | 15.434244 
2 | T-Junction on Goodwill Rd | -61.388860 | 15.315476

* To delete a point, click on the ```Delete Point``` tool on the toolbar and click on the point you want to delete. 
* You can also move the GCP point to a desired location by clicking on the ```Move GCP Point``` tool and clicking on the target point and move it to where you want.

Once about three ground control points are added, you may see the georeferencing error as a red line coming out of the points. The error in pixels can be seen also in the ```GCP table``` in the ```dX(pixels)``` and ```dY(pixels)``` columns. Error in pixels should not be higher than 10 pixels. If it is, you should review the points you have digitized and the coordinates you have entered to find what the problem is.

The GCPs can be saved for later use:

* Go to ```File --> Save GCP points asâ€¦```. Specify the name and location and save.

To complete the georeferencing:
 
* Go to ```File --> Start Georeferencing```. The georeferencing is completed and the layer is added to the map canvas.
