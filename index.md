# Welcome to Geo-informatics for Agriculture

This course introduces you to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using QGIS.

## Description

Strategic and operational management of national agriculture requires several spatial datasets. Integration of the varied datasets in a spatial database permits easy data management and analysis to support decision making. Geographic Information System (GIS) software provides a framework to support spatial data collection, management and analysis. This training manual introduces theoretical concepts and practical activities that reinforce understanding of agricultural spatial data management and analysis.

## Topics
The course will introduce the following topics:
* Introduction to GIS
* Capturing and creating data
* Geographic and projected coordinate systems
* Geodatabases
* Spatial analysis and visualization

<!-- Details of each topic are shown below:

|Day | Topics | Activities | Outcomes |
| 1 | Introduction | Introduction to QGIS interface, GIS data models and structures | Participants are familiar with QGIS interface and key tools, can load and interact with vector/raster data, change symbology, open attribute table, create layouts and print maps. |
| 2 | Capturing/creating data | On-screen digitizing | Participants are able to digitize features from scanned map and Google Earth (convert between kml/kmz/shapefile), import GPS data to shapefile, update attribute table, convert between raster and vector data. |
| 3 | Project and reproject data |  Participants are able to identify the coordinate system of a layer, distinguish between GCS and PCS, assign and transform coordinate systems to a layer and georeference an image. |
| 4 | Geodatabases |  Create and populate geodatabases | Participants understand key concepts of relational databases and are able to create, populate and edit geodatabases. |
| 5 | Spatial analysis and visualization | Undertake basic spatial analysis | Participants understand the main categories of spatial analysis, are able to design analytical steps to solve a spatial problem using vector or raster data and visualize the analytical output. -->
