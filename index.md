# Welcome to Geo-informatics for Agriculture

This course introduces you to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using QGIS.

## Description

Strategic and operational management of national agriculture requires several spatial datasets. Integration of the varied datasets in a spatial database permits easy data management and analysis to support decision making. Geographic Information System (GIS) software provides a framework to support spatial data collection, management and analysis. This training manual introduces theoretical concepts and practical activities that reinforce understanding of agricultural spatial data management and analysis.

## Topics

The course will introduce the following topics:

* Introduction to GIS
* Capturing and creating data
* Geographic and projected coordinate systems
* Spatial databases
* Spatial analysis and visualization

## Software requirements

* Windows 10 or 11 environment.
* QGIS 3.28 LTR 'Firenze' available at this link [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
* Datasets for the course are available for download on each topic page.
